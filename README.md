# README
This is a Ruby on Rails web application which will allow users to Sign Up and post blogs of their own.
An overview of the features the app provides:
- Allows the users to post blogs once they Sign Up or Log In(if they are already signed up)
- Allows the users to view blogs posted by others even if they are not logged in. But then they can not use the additional features which the app provided which are listed below.

The navigation bar comprises of **'Sign Up'** and **'Log in'** as soon as you land into the app. 

Once you **'Sign Up'** using your email-id, the navigation bar will display additional **'Sign Out'** and **'New Blog'** tabs.

The **'New Blog'** tab can be used to create and post your blogs. 

As soon as you click on **'New Blog'**, two input fields will be seen. One will be **'Blog title'**, where you give your blog a title. The other one will be **'Blog Description'**, where the actual content of the blog will be entered. Then click on **'Create Blog'** and there you go!

You will realise that you have actually **posted** your first blog! The blog will apear in the form of a tile where just the title of the blog will be visible and you need to clik on the **'View Blog'** buttoon in order to see it.

Once you click on **'View Blog'**, you will see a bigger tile screen with the 'title' of the blog on top. Just below the **'Title'** will appear a statement which will tell the readers the email address of the person who posted the blog. It will also show the *number of hours* before which the blog was posted. 

For e.g., a blog which was posted 6 hours ago by me will show **'Posted by aviralverma.verma@gmail.com about 6 hours ago'**.

This statemnt will be followed by the actual content of the blog. Just below the blog will be a heading **'Comments:**, where all the comments of the blog will appear(i.e. if any user commented on the blog then his/her comments will appear here.) If you yourself commented on any blog, then you will get to see two buttons namely **'Edit'** and **'Delete'** allowing you to modify and delete your comment respectively. Remember you cannot edit or delete comments of any other user.

Just below the **'Comments:'** heading will be a heading **'Reply to Blog'** with an input field below it where users can actually write comments related to the blog by pressing the **'Create Comment'** button.

Then you will see three more buttons, mainly **'Back'**, **'Edit'** and **'Delete'** buttons allowing you to 'go back to the main page of the app', to edit the blog and to delete the blog respectively. Remember **'Edit'**, and **'Delete'** fetaures are accessible only to the blogs created by you. You can not edit or delete te blogs created by any other user.

You can go back to the main page either by pressing the **'Back'** button at the bottom or by clicking on the top most heading at the top which says **'BLOGS(CREATED BY AVIRAL VERMA)'**
