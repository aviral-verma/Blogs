# README
This is a Ruby on Rails web application which will allow users to Sign Up and post blogs of their own.

The navigation bar comprises of **'Sign Up'** and **'Log in'** as soon as you land into the app. 

Once you **'Sign Up'** using your email-id, the navigation bar will display additional **'Sign Out'** and **'New Blog'** tabs.

The **'New Blog'** tab can be used to create and post your blogs. 

As soon as you click on **'New Blog'**, two input fields will be seen. One will be **'Blog title'**, where you give your blog a title. The other one will be **'Blog Description'**, where the actual content of the blog will be entered. Then click on **'Create Blog'** and there you go!

You will realise that you have actually **posted** your first blog! The blog will apear in the form of a tile where just the title of the blog will be visible and you need to clik on the **'View Blog'** buttoon in order to see it.

Once you click on **'View Blog'**, you will see a bigger tile screen with the 'title' of the blog on top. Just below the **'Title'** will appear a statement which will tell the readers the email address of the person who posted the blog. It will also show the *number of hours* before which the blog was posted. 

For e.g., a blog which was posted 6 hours ago by me will show **'Posted by aviralverma.verma@gmail.com about 6 hours ago'**.

This statemnt will be followed by the actual content of the blog. Just below the blog will be a heading **'Comments:**, where all the comments of the blog will appear(i.e. if any user commented on the blog then his/her comments will appear here.)

Just below the **'Comments:'** heading will be a heading **'Reply to Blog'** with an input field below it where users can actually write comments related to the blog by pressing the **'Create Comment'** button.

Then you will see three more buttons, mainly **'Back'**, **'Edit'** and **'Delete'** buttons allowing you to 'go back to the main page of the app', to edit the blog and to delete the blog respectively. Remember **'Edit'**, and **'Delete'** fetaures are accessible only to the blogs created by you. You can not edit or delete te blogs created by any other user.
